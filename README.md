# d2s-editor

This is a fork of [dschu012/d2s-editor](https://github.com/dschu012/d2s-editor/) written in React and TypeScript

[Example](http://d2s.txc.se/)

This is a basic Diablo 2 save editor for D2 and D2R. The parser uses the TXT data from the Diablo 2 MPQs so the editor could be repurposed for basic TXT mods. Some of the main features are:

* Modify basic stats (str/lvl/gold/etc...)
* Modify quest status
* Modify waypoints
* Import items (~1000 different items to import)
* Modify basic stats on items
* Copy item between chars (drag between browser windows)

### How to use on your own mod

1. Clone this repo or download a zip.
2. Extract your MPQ data to a data folder in the same directory as the repo. (the tool needs TXTs, strings, pallettes, and item dc6s to work properly)
3. Run a simple http server hosting this directory (e.g. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), [IIS](https://www.iis.net/))
4. Go to http://localhost:${PORT}/constants.html. Follow instructions to generate the TXT constant data for the save parser.
5. Go to http://localhost:${PORT}/ verify everything works.
